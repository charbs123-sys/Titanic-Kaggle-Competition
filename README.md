This project examines the impact of different strategies involving the handling of missing data and how this impacts predictive accuracy. These are extracted from Hyung Kangs article on the prevention and handling of missing data entailing a plethora of methods to achieve the aforementioned goal. The R code is generalised to be used on most datasets and cross validation with different basic classification models such as logistic regression, LDA, QDA, naive bayes and random forest (RF).

RF was deemed the most suitable model after using cross validation and accuracy as the unerlying metric. We eventually achieve a score of 0.77751 after some parameter tuning and thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 

The aforementioned results will be updated accordingly once parameters have been tuned to achieve more suitable results.
